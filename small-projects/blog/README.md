# React TypeScript Blog

## Description

This React and TypeScript blog application allows users to create, view, and delete blog posts. It serves as a practice project to learn and implement React components, state management, and basic CRUD operations.

-   \*List Posts\*\*: Displays all blog posts in a chronological order.
-   **Delete Posts**: Each post can be deleted using a delete button associated with it.

## Project Setup

Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed before setting up the project.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-ts-blog.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd react-ts-blog
    ```

3. Install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Launch the development server with hot reload at localhost:

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Technology Stack

-   **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
-   **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

## Project Structure

    -   `components/`: Reusable UI components.
    -   `App.tsx`: Main React component that serves as the entry point for the React components.
    -   `index.tsx`: Entry file for React which renders the `App` component.
-   `index.html`: Root HTML file where the React app is mounted.
-   `vite.config.ts`: Configuration file for Vite.
