- **Basic Concept**: Components in React are like the building blocks of a user interface, similar to LEGO pieces for your application. Each component can contain its own logic, style, and content, and they work together to create the whole UI.

- **Types of Components**:
  - **Class Components**: These are more traditional in React and include features like lifecycle methods and state management.
  - **Functional Components**: Increasingly popular due to their simplicity and use of hooks like `useState` for managing state and effects in the application.

- **Reusability and Props**:
  - Components can be reused throughout the application, which makes maintaining and updating the app easier.
  - They receive data through 'props', allowing for flexibility and customization. For example, a Header component might receive different titles or navigation options depending on where itâ€™s used.

- **Composition**:
  - Components can be nested within each other, enabling a modular and scalable structure. This means you can assemble complex interfaces from simple, individual parts.

- **Practical Example**:
  - Consider a website with a Header and Footer component. These components might appear on every page but show different information or links based on the user's navigation, all managed via props.

This breakdown makes the explanation clearer and more approachable, focusing on the practical aspects and significance of components in React development.
