What is react and why use it?

What is react?

•	React is a JS library developed by Facebook  for building user interfaces, and especially SPA(single page applications) where the dynamic content is key
•	it allows developers to create web applications that can update and render efficiently by organizing the user interface into reusable components, which helps with the development experience as well
•	each component manages it’s own state and can be constructed to make complex UI’s more manageable.
•	The declerative nature of react also contributes to the development experience, for example instead of directly manipulating the DOM, you can describe ui changes using react, that will trigger based on changes in state



In programming, a declarative approach involves describing what you want to achieve without explicitly detailing how to achieve it. This contrasts with an imperative approach, where you must provide the exact steps to achieve the result.
